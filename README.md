# Custom Paintings
This mod lets you to change the texture of the paintings very easily!

# Features
- Sync with server to make all clients see the same painting.
- Supports up to 5 different textures in the same day to prevent duplicated ones if you find several paintings.
- Includes 8 default paintings of famous works that you can use as templates to make your custom ones.

# Instalation and use
You only need to have installed BepInEx and move "CustomPaintings.dll" to 'lethal Company\\BepInEx\\plugins' folder.

Once you open the game, it will create a "CustomPaintings" folder in that directory with the default paintings.

Then you only have to add your own designs to that folder and it's done!

Everytime the ship lands the mod will pick 5 differents images of that folder and will use them as painting textures.

# Warnings
Keep in mind that all clients must have the same images in the folder, however each one will see a different texture.

Sadly, when you left the game the paintings will lose the custom texture. If you know a way to solve that please contact me by Github or Discord, thanks.

For any problem or question you can comment in the issues section of my [Github](https://github.com/BoniatoRelleno/Ganimedes) or in the CustomPaintings thread located in the "mod-releases" channel of the [Lethal Company Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/6ds27tH8). All support is appreciated <3
