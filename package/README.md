# Custom Paintings

This mod lets you to change the texture of the paintings very easily!

## Features

- Sync with server to make all clients see the same painting.
- Includes 8 default paintings of famous works that you can use as templates to make your custom ones.
- Saving painting between reloads

## Instalation and use

You only need to have installed BepInEx and move "CustomPaintings.dll" to 'lethal Company\\BepInEx\\plugins' folder.

Once you open the game, it will create a "CustomPaintings" folder in that directory with the default paintings.

Then you only have to add your own designs to that folder and it's done!

## Warnings

Keep in mind that all clients must have the same images in the folder, however each one will see a different texture.

If host uses that mod all clients must install also this mod. They can not use custom textures, but it needed for correct data exchange.

For any problem or question you can comment in the issues section of my [Github](https://github.com/BoniatoRelleno/Ganimedes) or in the CustomPaintings thread located in the "mod-releases" channel of the [Lethal Company Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/6ds27tH8). All support is appreciated <3
